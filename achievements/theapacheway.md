The Apache Way

The second Hackathon by EU FOSSA was a good opportinity for an outside observer to get a sense of how Open Source works "The Apache Way". 

Many Apache Project Management Committee members from different projects were part of the event and showed attendees not part of any Apache community how projects are working at Apache. Just a week after the Apache Software Foundations 20 year anniversary the Hackathon showed some how an Open Source community works for the first time. A few members from European institutions got the chance to chance to talk directly to the people involved in the big Open Source community which should be a good start for understanding better how to support Open Source projects in the future.

The Apache way is all about community. Decission are made together and take place in public. It can be hard to understand to understand how and why Open Source and Apache works from the outside. When you start talking to Apache contributors and work with them even it is not producing code you start to get a feeling why it is so successfull and important.
